* Understand general JS syntax
* Grasp why functions are important
* Understand arrays and loops
* Be able to recite the meaning and importance of SOLID principles
* Be able to breakdown a simple process of mathematical steps into a series of statements in JS

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to effectively use:

* The terminal and `node` to test your JS

## Details

### Deliverables

* A repo containing atleast:
  * `main.js`

### Requirements

* No JSHint warnings or errors
* All functions should be complete and produce the expected output

## Easy Mode

Create a new Github repo and add [./exercises-1.js](./exercises-1.js) to it. Make your edits to the functions in the "exercises-1" file.

Instead of using the browser and the Chrome Dev Tools console to look at your JS output, use `node exercises-1.js` to print the output to your terminal.
