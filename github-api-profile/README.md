## Easy Mode

Build a github profile app that prints out some info from the Github API and your repos. For the design, you should recreate the UI for the Github Repos page (e.g. https://github.com/matthiasak?tab=repositories).

The information from the Github API that you will display includes information from your github user account and repositories.

    - `https://api.github.com/users/<username>`
    - `https://api.github.com/users/<username>/repos`
